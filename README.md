# Object-detection-using-CV
🔍 Object Detection using CV Object Detection using Computer Vision (CV) is a system that identifies and locates objects in images or video in real time. It detects multiple objects, draws bounding boxes around them, and labels them, enabling applications like security monitoring, smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and AI-powered analytics.

🖥️ Object Detection Using Computer Vision (Fully HTML-Based)

🔍 Project Overview

Object Detection using Computer Vision (CV) is a project that identifies and locates objects in images or live video streams in real time. The system draws bounding boxes around detected objects and labels them, providing visual and actionable information about the scene.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Fully HTML-Based Implementation:

The entire project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, running entirely in a web browser. No backend, installation, or heavy software is required. The system uses the browser’s camera access and computer vision APIs to detect objects in real time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate real-time object detection using web technologies, showing how Computer Vision can be implemented directly in the browser. It is designed to be lightweight, accessible, and beginner-friendly, while still providing accurate object detection for multiple use cases.

🧠 Core Working Principle

1️⃣ Camera or Image Input

The project can use live camera feed or uploaded images.

The browser captures each frame and prepares it for analysis.


2️⃣ Object Detection Algorithm

The system applies pre-trained machine learning models for object detection.

Popular models often used: YOLO, COCO-SSD, or TensorFlow.js models.

Each frame is scanned to identify multiple objects simultaneously.


3️⃣ Bounding Boxes and Labels

Detected objects are highlighted with rectangular bounding boxes.

Labels (e.g., “person”, “chair”, “bottle”) are displayed on each box.

The detection updates in real time for live camera feed.


4️⃣ Real-Time Visualization

The processed frames with bounding boxes are displayed on the web page.

Users can see live detection and interact with the system directly in the browser.


🌐 HTML-Based Implementation

Fully built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Runs directly in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

Uses Web APIs like getUserMedia for camera access and TensorFlow.js or other JS-based ML libraries for detection.

No installation or backend server required.

Lightweight and easily shareable online (e.g., GitHub Pages).


▶️ How Users Interact

Open the HTML file in a browser.

Allow camera access when prompted.

The live video feed appears on the screen.

The system detects objects in real time, draws bounding boxes, and labels them.

Users can move objects in front of the camera to see live detection updates.

Alternatively, users can upload an image to detect objects in a static frame.
